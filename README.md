## Getting Started

There are a couple ways to download the calculator:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/jacobhallberg/Python-GUI-Calculator/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jacobhallberg/Python-GUI-Calculator.git` 


### What's in the Download?

The download includes the Calculator.py and ExeCal.py files. The Calculator.py file has the structural components of the GUI and the ExeCal.py file contains the functional aspects of the buttons, as well as the calculations needed.

The download also includes a standalone exe file which can be used to run the calculator directly without a call to Python.


### Why use this Calculator?
It's simple, it's quick, and it was built fully with python.

## OS Support

- Windows
- Linux
- Mac

The above list is non-exhaustive. This calculator uses a Python built GUI and thus can be used on any platform that can run .py or a .exe.
